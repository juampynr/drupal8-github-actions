This project defines a GitHub Actions workflow to run a set of Continuous
Integration jobs when code is pushed to https://github.com/juampynr/drupal8-github-actions.

The database is hosted at https://quay.io/repository/juampynr/drupal8-github-actions?tab=tags.
Details on how to use and build this image are at [scripts/database/README.md](scripts/database/README.md).
