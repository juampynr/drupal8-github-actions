# Drupal 8 and GitHub Actions

![](https://github.com/juampynr/drupal8-github-actions/workflows/Tests%20and%20code/badge.svg)

This project defines a GitHub Actions workflow to run a set of Continuous
Integration jobs when code is pushed to https://github.com/juampynr/drupal8-github-actions.

The database is hosted at https://quay.io/repository/juampynr/drupal8-github-actions?tab=tags.
Details on how to use and build this image are at [scripts/database/README.md](scripts/database/README.md).

There is an one-line installer at https://github.com/Lullabot/drupal8ci#github-actions that
places all the required files to run this workflow in your Drupal 8 project.
